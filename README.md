# Uniteras
Uniteras is a computer program capable of identifying the type of soil according to each standard, as well as of finding such possible "correspondences" between different classes of soils belonging to different soil classification systems. Using the geotechnical data available for a particular soil, Uniteras identifies the classification in any of the four classification systems , namely : AASHO, RTR, USCS and the Romanian  Rom-Standard .
